## Summary

This site is implemented using the [Amplify Jekyll theme](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify) as a starting point. The primary feature is utilization of the [AMP Project](https://www.ampproject.org/) from Google to make pages really, really, really ridiculously performant :sparkles:.

Having used [custom elements](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/) extensively for over a year, it was great to see the AMP Project pick up [technologies](https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element) I utilize heavily. Creating this blog is as much an excuse for playing with AMP :zap: as a way to kindle my involvement in the software development community :fire:.
