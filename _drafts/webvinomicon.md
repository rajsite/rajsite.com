Welcome to the WebVInomicon, the dark arts of unsafe WebVI programming.
The contents of this page and linked examples are experimental at best.
DO NOT USE ANY OF THESE EXAMPLES FOR ANYTHING YOU VALUE.

Taking inspiration from the [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/):
This page digs into awful details to write unsafe WebVIs.
The nature of these examples, may lead to unleashing untold horrors that shatter your psyche into a billion infinitesimal fragments of despair.

You have been warned. :smiling_imp:
